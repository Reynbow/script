# Script

Main scripts.

If you're here, you know why.


### script.ahk
This is the main script that everyone opens to launch everything. 
Stupidly long code that could definitely be cleaned up by someone that doesn't mind going insane trying to do so.

### HSNET Config.ahk
Main config file that is used on Windows 10 sites for the initial install and test run.

### Idle.ahk
Tool used to check for errors on sites automatically.

### Loyalty Install.ahk
Fairly standard script that likely will rarely need to be changed or updated. 

### QAComplete.ahk
Same as above, fairly stable and wont need many changes.

### csv.ahk
Library used for looking up data in CSV files. Don't touch this. It works, doesn't need changing.

### updater_v2.ahk
Pretty simple and likely wont need changing, unless more programs are added. 
The main script launches this to do the updates.
