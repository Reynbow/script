This folder contains the Edit library, add-on functions for the Edit library,
and functions that allow the example scripts to run.  The scripts are identified
as follows:

 -  Edit.ahk.  This is the primary Edit library.

 -  Files that begin with "Edit_".  These are add-on functions to the Edit
    library.  These functions need the Edit library to operate but are not
    included directly in the Edit library.  There are a few add-on functions
    that call other add-on functions.  Also, a few add-functions require
    external functions/libraries.

 -  Everything else.  These functions are used by the example scripts.
