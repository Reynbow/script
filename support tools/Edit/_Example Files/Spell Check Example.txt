Glacier
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
(Redirected from Glaciers)

A glacier is a large body of ice and snow. A glacier forms because in a particular spot, the snow does not all mealt in summer. Each winter more snow is added, and the weight of all the snow creates pressure that turns the lower parts into ice. After many years of this happening, the glacier will start growing very big. It becomes so heavy that gravity makes the ice flow downwards like water, just much more slowly - only about 50 metres (164.04 feet) per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away.

Glaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough snow over time. This can take a long time, normally hundreds or thousands of yaers. There are two kinds of glaciers: continental glaciers and alpine, or mountin, glaciers.

Continental glaciers are glaciers that spread out over a lot of land. They showed up mostly during the Ice Ages a long time ago, but there are still some continental glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. They often flow downwards into the sea, where they break up. The broken parts that float in the sea are called icebergs.

Alpine glaciers are smaller than continental glaciers and form in mountin areas. They usually flow down until they reach a point where it's so warm that the ice mealts completely during the summer.

Glaciers are very important because they affect the environment a lot. They do this because they are very big and heavy, so they erode mountins and land when they move and scratch the rock they sit on. Also, since they froze long ago, snow crystals and air bubbles inside are kept in good condition for scientists to look at. Nowadays, glaciers have been mealting more than they used to because the climate is changing and global warming is happening.

Glaciers are the largest deposits of fresh water on Earth. The largest bodies of salt water are the oceans.

Glaciers appear blue in color because water (including the frozen water that makes up glaciers) is very good at absorbing light. Only the strongest light with the most energy is able to escape. Blue is the color of light that has the most energy, so blue is the only color of light that can escape without being absorbed. The thicker the glacier is, the more blue it appears.
